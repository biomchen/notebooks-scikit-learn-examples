The original files are in python file format and can be found at [scikit-learn github](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/95d4f0841d57e8b5f6b2a570312e9d832e69debc).
The partial codes of the tool I compiled for converting .py to .ipynb is from Remy Karem (https://github.com/remykarem/python2jupyter).
