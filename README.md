## Jupyter Notebooks of Scikit-Learn Examples
The original Scikit-Learn examples are in .py format and can be found at\
[scikit-learn github](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/95d4f0841d57e8b5f6b2a570312e9d832e69debc).\
I complied some codes to automate the py-to-ipynb conversion. The codes of \
module p2j.py to convert .py to .ipynb is part of the python package written by \
[Remy Karem](https://github.com/remykarem/python2jupyter).
